prd.md — What the system should do

PRD explains what the project is, why we are building it, and what the system needs to do.

Our project is a Stock + Sales Management System.

Staff can record sales.
Stock is automatically deducted when a sale is made.
Stock staff can update and add stock.
The system has login and role-based permissions.
The CEO can access all information.
The Dashboard shows company sales and salesperson performance using graphs.
The system keeps an Audit Log showing who did what and when.
Data can be exported as CSV.
The system supports Thai and English.

## 1. What — Summary

Stock and Sales Management is an internal web application for managing
inventory and sales information.

The system allows staff to update stock quantities, record sales,
automatically deduct sold quantities from stock, and track sales performance.

The system also provides a dashboard for the CEO/Manager to view an overall
summary of company performance, inventory status, and individual salesperson
performance and the Forecast Features.

- **Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Data storage:** SQLite via `better-sqlite3`, single local database file
- **Deployment (v1):** Local only — runs on a machine on-site

---

## 2. Why — Problem & Motivation

Currently, stock and sales information may be managed using paper documents
or spreadsheets. This can make it difficult to:

- Track current stock accurately
- Know which products are running low
- Keep sales information organized
- Review salesperson performance
- See an overall picture of company sales
- Determine who changed or entered information
- Make purchasing and restocking decisions quickly

**Goal:** provide a simple system for staff to record stock and sales
information while giving the CEO/Manager a clear overview of inventory and
sales performance.

---

## 3. Who — Users / Personas

### CEO / Manager (Admin)

The CEO/Manager has access to all information and system management functions.

Key needs:

- View all stock information
- View all sales information
- View company-wide dashboard
- View salesperson performance
- Manage users
- Manage SKUs
- Correct stock or sales information when necessary
- View complete audit history
- Export reports and data

### Staff / Operator

Operators have specific responsibilities within the company.

Each user can only access functions and information relevant to their assigned
responsibilities.

Examples of responsibilities may include:

- Salesperson
- Stock/warehouse staff
- Other operational staff

A user must log in before accessing the system.

Users cannot access another user's private or restricted information unless
they have sufficient permissions.

---

## 4. Authentication & Permission Model

### 4.1 Authentication

- All users must log in using username/password.
- There is no public/self-registration.
- User accounts are created and managed by an Admin.
- Passwords must be stored securely as password hashes.

### 4.2 Permissions

The system has two main access levels:

- **Admin:** CEO/Manager with full system access.
- **Operator:** staff member with access based on their assigned responsibility.

Operators should only see and modify information they are authorized to access.

The system must perform permission checks at both route and action level.

---

## 5. Core Features

### 5.1 SKU Management

The system allows authorized users to manage products/SKUs.

Each SKU contains:

- SKU code
- Name
- Description
- Type
- Unit
- Low-stock threshold
- Stale-check threshold
- Current quantity
- Automatically generated QR code
- Active/inactive status

Authorized users can:

- Create SKU
- Edit SKU
- Deactivate SKU
- Search SKU
- View SKU details
- Scan QR code to quickly identify a SKU

Operators are allowed to create new SKUs according to the group's permission
decision, while unauthorized users cannot perform SKU management actions.

---

### 5.2 Stock Update

Staff can update the current quantity of a SKU.

A stock update records:

- SKU
- Previous quantity
- New quantity
- User who performed the action
- Date/time
- Action type

The system must validate that stock quantity cannot become negative.

---

### 5.3 Add Stock / Restock

Staff can record newly received stock separately from a normal stock count.

Example:

Current stock = 50

Add stock = 20

New stock = 70

The system records:

- SKU
- Quantity added
- Previous quantity
- New quantity
- User
- Date/time
- Action type

---

### 5.4 Sales Recording

The system must support recording a complete sales transaction.

One sale can contain multiple products/items.

A sales transaction may contain:

#### Sale information

- Document/invoice number
- Customer ID
- Customer name
- Salesperson
- Total amount
- Payment information/status
- System-generated date/time

#### Sale items

Each item contains:

- SKU/product code
- Product description
- Quantity
- Unit
- Unit price
- Item total

The system calculates the item total and overall sale total.

Users do not need to manually enter the sale date.
The system records the date/time automatically.

---

### 5.5 Automatic Stock Deduction

When a sale is successfully recorded, the system automatically deducts the
sold quantity from the corresponding SKU stock.

Example:

Current stock = 100

Sold = 15

New stock = 85

The system must ensure that a sale cannot cause stock quantity to become
negative.

Stock deduction and sale recording should be performed as a single database
transaction so that the system does not record a sale without updating stock,
or update stock without recording the sale.

---

### 5.6 Dashboard

The dashboard provides a simple visual overview of company performance.

### CEO/Manager Dashboard

The CEO can view:

- Total number of SKUs
- Current stock status
- Low-stock items
- Stale stock items
- Total sales
- Sales performance by salesperson
- Sales trends over time
- Other important company-level summaries

The dashboard should use graphs and charts where appropriate so that important
information can be understood quickly.

Examples:

- Total sales by month
- Sales by salesperson
- Sales trend over time
- Low-stock summary
- Top-selling products

### Time Filters

The CEO should be able to select a time period such as:

- Today
- Last 7 days
- This month
- Last month
- Custom date range

---

### 5.7 Salesperson Performance

Salesperson performance is primarily measured by sales value.

The system should allow the CEO to compare salespeople based on:

- Total sales amount
- Sales amount during a selected time period
- Sales trend over time

The dashboard should present this information using easy-to-read graphs.

---

### 5.8 Export

The system supports exporting data for external reporting.

Supported format:

- CSV

The system should also support exporting a visual report containing important
dashboard information and graphs when technically feasible.

The exported report should be suitable for management review.

---

### 5.9 Audit Log

Every important stock and sales-changing action must be recorded.

The audit log records:

- User
- Action
- Affected data
- Previous value
- New value
- Date/time

Examples of actions:

- Create SKU
- Edit SKU
- Deactivate SKU
- Update stock
- Add stock
- Create sale
- Modify sale
- Correct stock
- Correct sales information
- User management actions

Audit history must not be silently deleted when information is corrected.

This allows the CEO/Manager to review who performed an action and what was
changed.

The purpose is to improve accountability and help detect unauthorized or
suspicious changes.
